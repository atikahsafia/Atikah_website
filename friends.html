                        Ain Husna has been my best friend since the very first semester of university. From the moment we met, 
                        we instantly connected, and our bond has only grown stronger with time. She has been by my side through every twist and turn, offering
                        unwavering support and kindness, especially during my most challenging moments. Husna is more
                        than just a friend, she is a source of comfort and strength when I need it the most.

                         These are my housemates from the semester one. Although we no longer share the same house, the bond we formed remains as strong as ever.
                         Despite living apart now, we continue to care deeply for one another and make an effort to stay connected.
                         My housemates, Sarah, Wana, and Nadia hold a special place i my heart, and the memories we created together will always be cherished.
                         During our time living under the same roof, we sgared countless moments that brought us closer. From late-night study sessions to cooking meals together,
                         every moment was filled with laughter, support, and companionship. We often spent sharing advice and personal stories. These heartfelt conversations always left me
                         feeling understood and uplifted.

                        These are my classmates from the first semester all the way through to the fifth semester of university. Over the years, we’ve shared countless experiences and challenges, and our journey together has been one of immense growth and learning. From the very beginning, we were all thrown into the whirlwind of university life, each of us with different backgrounds and aspirations. Yet, as time passed, we became more than just classmates we became a close-knit group of friends, learning and evolving together.
                        Throughout these semesters, we have faced academic pressures, long nights of studying, and moments of doubt. But we’ve also celebrated victories, both big and small, from acing exams to completing group projects successfully. These moments were made all the more meaningful because we supported each other every step of the way. Whether it was helping each other understand difficult concepts, sharing notes, or simply being there for moral support, we truly became a team. 
                        Our connection goes beyond academics. We’ve spent time together in and outside of class, forming friendships that will last long after graduation. We’ve laughed, shared stories, and created unforgettable memories that will stay with us for years to come. The late-night study sessions, spontaneous hangouts, and even the quiet moments of reflection have all contributed to making our bond special.
                        As we continue our journey through university, I am grateful for the friendships we’ve built and the lessons we’ve learned from each other. Every one of my classmates has contributed something unique to this experience, and I know that these connections will continue to shape our lives, both academically and personally, for years to come.
